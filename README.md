OOOH
There’s a power in your soul
OOOH
And I wanted you to know
Only you can help that
magic to unfold
So be true to yourself
There was something
to behold, yeah
OOOH
There’s a power in your soul
OOOH
And I wanted you to know
Only you can help
that magic to unfold
So be true to yourself
There was something
to behold, yeah
OOOH
There’s a power in your soul
OOOH
And I wanted you to know
Only you can help
that magic to unfold
So be true to yourself
There was something
to behold, yeah
I’ve been up and down
But I see clearly now
Eyes open and start
to feel the power within
This brand new energy
is taking over me
Is taking over me, yeah
Feels so good to lose
all of our control
I turn to choose to reignite
your soul
Set your heart free
and just let go
Time to just let go
Just let go
Gotta be
Better be
Gonna be
Free
Gotta be
Better be
Gonna be
Seen
Only you can help
that magic to unfold
So be true to yourself
OOOH
There’s a power in your soul
OOOH
And I wanted you to know
Only you can help
that magic to unfold
So be true to yourself
There was something
to behold, yeah
OOOH
There’s a power in your soul
OOOH
And I wanted you to know
Only you can help
that magic to unfold
So be true to yourself
There was something
to behold, yeah
OOOH
There’s a power in your soul
OOOH
And I wanted you to know
Only you can help
that magic to unfold
So be true to yourself
There was something
to behold, yeah
See you across the room
Lights shining outta you
Been here before the fire
that you can’t ignore
We can’t deny it
It’s taking over you
And taking over me, too
Feels so good to lose
all of our control
I turn to choose
to reignite your soul
Set your heart free
and just let go
Time to just let go
Just let go
OOOH (And just let go)
There’s a power in your soul
OOOH
(And a power in your soul)
There’s a power in your soul
OOOH
(And a power in your soul)
There’s a power in your soul
OOOH
(A power in your soul)
And I wanted you to know
